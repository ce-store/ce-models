conceptualise a ~ thing ~ T that
  has the value PF as ~ plural form ~ and
  has the value PT as ~ past tense ~ and
  ~ is expressed by ~ the value V.

conceptualise a ~ suppressed concept ~ SC.
Note: this concept will be suppressed in the queries; no instances will be returned if they are a configuration concept.

conceptualise a ~ configuration concept ~ CC that is a suppressed concept.
conceptualise an ~ uninteresting concept ~ UC that is a suppressed concept.

--Ensure that the meta-model concepts are all suppressed
--conceptualise a ~ concept ~ C that is a configuration concept.
--conceptualise a ~ conceptual model ~ C that is a configuration concept.
--conceptualise a ~ sequence ~ S that is a configuration concept.
--conceptualise a ~ statement ~ S that is a configuration concept.
--conceptualise a ~ symbol ~ S that is a configuration concept.

conceptualise a ~ sourced concept ~ S that
  is a configuration concept and
  has the source S as ~ source ~.

conceptualise a ~ supporting concept ~ S that is a local concept.

conceptualise a ~ separately identified concept ~ SC that
  is a configuration concept.
Note: this is a concept for which the id is not a natural identifier

conceptualise a ~ externally sourced property concept ~ C that
  is a property concept and
  has the source S as ~ source ~.

--conceptualise a ~ linguistic thing ~ L that
--  is a configuration concept and
--  has the value PF as ~ plural form ~ and
--  has the value PT as ~ past tense ~ and
--  has the value DD as ~ default determiner ~ and
--  has the value PQ as ~ property qualifier ~ and
--  ~ is expressed by ~ the value V and
--  ~ is qualified by ~ the entity concept E.

conceptualise a ~ common word list ~ CWL that
  is a configuration concept and
  has the value CW as ~ common word ~.

conceptualise a ~ negation word list ~ NWL that
  is a configuration concept and
  has the value NW as ~ negation word ~.

  has the value CAAC as ~ compute ability to answer confidence ~ and
  has the value DAC as ~ default answer confidence ~ and
  has the value DIC as ~ default interpretation confidence ~ and
  has the value DAAC as ~ default ability to answer confidence ~ and
  has the config list SD as ~ sentence delimiters ~ and
  has the config list PD as ~ phrase delimiters ~ and
  has the config list CD as ~ clause delimiters ~ and
  has the config list CP as ~ clause punctuation ~ and
  has the config list QS as ~ question start markers ~ and
  has the config list QE as ~ question end markers ~ and
  has the config list CW as ~ common words ~ and
  has the config list NW as ~ negation words ~.

conceptualise a ~ function ~ F.
conceptualise a ~ general function ~ F that is a function.
conceptualise a ~ filter function ~ F that is a function.
  
conceptualise a ~ config list ~ CL that
  is a configuration concept and
  has the value M as ~ marker ~.

conceptualise a ~ modifier ~ M that
  ~ corresponds to ~ the general function F and
  ~ uses by default ~ the entity concept E.

conceptualise a ~ filter modifier ~ M that
  is a modifier and
  ~ corresponds to ~ the filter function F and
  ~ involves ~ the entity concept EC.

conceptualise a ~ CE modifier ~ M that
  is a modifier and
  has the value U as ~ CE URL ~.

conceptualise an ~ end modifier ~ M that is a modifier.

conceptualise a ~ local concept ~ L that
  has the source SO as ~ source ~ and
  ~ is defined by ~ the glossary term G.

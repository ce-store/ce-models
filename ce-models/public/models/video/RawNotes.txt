As a video-coder,
I want to be able to ask natural language queries,
So that I can easily control what video snippets play and when, as well as getting insight on the data that has been created.

Functions done:

  "what is x" where x is a named instance, eg. Earth
  "who is x" where x is a named instance, eg. Narrator

  "list x" where x is a concept, eg. target or Planet

  "how many x" where x is a concept, instance or both.

  "how many clips x" where x is a concept.
  "how many videos x" where x is a concept.
  "how many events x" where x is a concept.

  "show x" where x is concept, instance, both or property.
  "play x" where x is concept, instance, both or property.

  "how long x" where x is a concept, instance or both.

  "what happened x" where x is a concept, instance or both.
  "what occurred x" where x is a concept, instance or both.

Assumptions made:
  (x = concept, y = instance)

  "show x y"     : show x filtered by y, eg. "show Earth's storms"
  "show x ... y" : show x and y, eg. "show Earth and storms"

Problems:

  Property names containing 'the' break CE
  chatty text for 'what is'
  Assumption for show/play function fails for Q4.
  <TIME> is a Double, no units

Fixed:

  list - Fails with weird plurals, eg. people - solution: 'has plural form as ...'

Working questions:

1. "Show me all videos with <TARGET> in"
2. "Show me a playlist of the <TAG>"
3. "Play the clips of the <TARGET>'s <TAG>'s"
13. "Show me videos of <TARGET> and <TARGET>"
14. "Show me videos of <TARGET> and <TAG>"
15. "Show me videos of <TAG> and <TAG>"
47. "Play video of <PROPERTY>"

7. "How many clips of the <TARGET> are there?"
34. "How many videos of the <TAG> are there?"

16. "How many <TARGET> and <TARGET>"
17. "How many <TEMPLATE>"
18. "How many <TEMPLATE> and <TARGET>"
19. "How many <TEMPLATE> and <TEMPLATE>"
20. "How many <TAG>?"
34. "How many events?"

5. "Play the video from <TIME> in"
6. "Play a clip lasting <TIME> from <TIME>"

21. "Play video after <TIME>"
22. "Play video past <TME>"
23. "Play video following <TIME>"
24. "Play video before <TIME>"
25. "Play video until <TIME>"
26. "Play video up to <TIME>"
27. "Play video to <TIME>"
28. "Play video from <TIME> to <TIME>"
29. "Play video between <TIME> and <TIME>" <- NOT WORKING
30. "Play video lasting <TIME>"
31. "Play video that lasts <TIME> from <TIME>"

** And any combination of 'play/show' <TARGET>/<TAG> from/before/between <TIMES>
   eg. "Play videos of Northern Lights that lasts <TIME> from <TIME>"

11. "How long did <EVENT> last?"
35: "How long was <TARGET> on screen for?"
36. "How long was <TAG>?"
37. "How long was <TARGET>'s <TAG>?"
38. "How long was <TARGET> and <TARGET>?"
39. "How long was <TAG> and <TAG>?"
40. "How long was <TARGET> and <TAG>?"

9. "What else happened during <EVENT>?"
41. "What happened during <TAG>?"
42. "What happened during <TARGET>?"
43. "What occurred during <TARGET> <TAG>?"

Broken questions:

4. "Show me the clips of the <TARGET> when there is a <TAG>"

8. "How many <TAG> videos are there for <TARGET>?"

Todo questions:

32. "Play video that lasts <TIME> until <TIME>"

10. "What occurs within <TIME> of <EVENT>?"

12. "What events happened together most?"
44. "Who is the most popular Person?"
45. "What Planet occurred the most?"
46. "What is the most popular tag?"
46. "What is the most popular target?"
46. "What is the most popular template?"

Todo:

Restrict template names in UI to stop conflicts with the core CE model, eg. location ?
Allow <TIME> formats other than doubles, eg. "10 seconds, 20 minutes"
Allow before/after filters to use (indexed) target/tags, eg. "Play video until the Storm, show video from the second Planet"
